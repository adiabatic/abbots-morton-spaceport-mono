# Abbots Morton Spaceport developer guide

## Making it go

```bash
make all
```

Dependencies are managed with `uv` and defined in `pyproject.toml`.

The M1 rebuild’s table-build kernel _is_ the Rust crate under `rebuild/kernel-rs/`, so a Rust toolchain — `cargo`, from [rustup](https://rustup.rs) — joins `uv` as a prerequisite for that side of the tree, and what it holds up is every table build: the crate is the only fixpoint since issue #78, so a box without `cargo` cannot build the M1 artifacts, settle a window, or run the rebuild test suite at all. `make kernel-build` builds it in release mode (the pipeline builds it itself before every fan-out). The font build itself needs none of this.

## Testing

Open `site/index.html` in a browser to test the font interactively.

For the repeatable workflow for finding Quikscript words in `site/the-manual.html` that are missing `data-expect` coverage elsewhere in the file, see [doc/checking-data-expect-coverage.md](doc/checking-data-expect-coverage.md).

## WIP word highlighting

`site/the-manual.html` is the only JavaScript consumer of `site/wip.json`. On load it fetches that file, parses it as a JSON array of strings, and adds the `.wip` class from `site/shared.css` to matching entries in the manual. If the file is missing, empty, or malformed, the code silently does nothing.

Each array item is a whitespace-separated sequence of Quikscript letter names using the names from `site/shared.js` (`Day`, `Roe`, `Eight`, `J'ai`, and so on). Tokens may also include a `.variant` suffix when you want to match a specific `data-expect` token variant.

```json
[
  "Day Roe Eight",
  "Way.alt At"
]
```

The matcher scans `[data-expect]`, `.pairings td`, `.pairings dd`, `.word-list td`, and `.word-list dd`. A sequence marks an element as WIP if either its `data-expect` contains the requested tokens in order or its text content contains the raw PUA substring built from the base letter names.

When there is no active WIP list, `site/wip.json` is intentionally checked in as `[]` rather than deleted: the highlighting machinery stays loaded on standby, and adding a new WIP entry is a one-line edit instead of restoring a deleted file.

## Quikscript data

Quikscript uses a family-based source schema in `glyph_data/quikscript.yaml`. Each family can define `mono`, `prop`, shared `shapes`, and additional `stances`; stances declare explicit `traits` / `modifiers`, can reuse scaffolding with `inherits`, and `select` / `derive` rules use structured family selectors plus top-level `context_sets` instead of compiled glyph-name strings. `tools/build_font.py` compiles that into the flat glyph map used by feature generation and tests. In VS Code, `.vscode/quikscript.schema.json` is associated with that file for hover docs and structural validation when the Red Hat YAML extension is installed.

The join compiler is split across `tools/quikscript_ir.py` and `tools/quikscript_fea.py`. `tools/build_font.py` owns generic font loading/building; Quikscript family compilation and generated join transforms live in the IR module; Senior feature analysis and `curs`/gated-feature/`calt`/stylistic-set emission live together in `tools/quikscript_fea.py`.

Within that pipeline, `tools/glyph_compiler.py` owns the canonical variant-level compilation result. `CompiledGlyphSet` carries legacy flat `glyphs:` data, compiled Quikscript `JoinGlyph`s, and merged glyph metadata; Quikscript stays in `JoinGlyph` form through feature analysis and emission, and only flattens back to raw glyph dicts at the final generic font-build boundary. Those flat glyph dicts are build materialization only; compiler metadata lives on `JoinGlyph`, not in `_base_name`-style keys on the flattened output.

## Shaping leaks: what you have to drive

A “shaping leak” is a letter changing shape across a pen-lift (a non-join) because of a neighbor it cannot actually connect to — the canonical case is a stroke reaching out to join a letter that isn’t there, dangling into space. The full definition and the design decisions behind it are in [doc/definitions/shaping-leakage.md](doc/definitions/shaping-leakage.md). The detection-and-classification machinery is built and runs on its own; this section is the part that needs _you_, because the calls it makes are judgment calls a human owns.

The machinery sorts every visible leak into **bad** (a real defect — a dangle) or **benign** (a subtractive trim, a standalone-variant swap, or an intentional cosmetic tuck — the slightly-hand-drawn variation we actually want). That sort is mechanical, validated to agree with your past triage exactly, but it is a proxy: when it is wrong, you correct it with an override (below). The two sets live in two checked-in files:

- `site/bad-leak-backlog.txt` — the defects still outstanding. This is the to-do list.
- `site/benign-leak-census.txt` — the welcome variation. This is a census, not a defect list.

### When a gate complains

- **`make test` (every run) fails with “NEW bad isolation leak(s)”.** A change you made grew a dangle. Either fix it — make the break-facing edge subtractive (or revert it) for that one context, using the levers in the tweak-an-old-font-join skill (`.claude/skills/tweak-an-old-font-join/SKILL.md`) — or, if you decide the new bad leak is actually acceptable, re-bless (next bullet) so it joins the backlog. Resolving an _existing_ backlog entry never fails the gate; it just prints a “nice — re-bless” notice.
- **`make test-leaks` (the deep, ≈1-minute gate) fails on the benign census.** The set of benign variation shifted. This is informational, never a defect on its own — but look at the diff so you _notice_ the organic-variation set moving, then re-bless.
- **Re-bless after any intended change:** `make leak-snapshot` regenerates both files. Always `git diff` them before committing — that diff is the whole point of the gate, and reviewing it is your job.

### When the bad/benign call is wrong (overrides)

The proxy occasionally mislabels a leak. You correct it per-signature, never by weakening the proxy:

- `site/leak-force-bad.yaml` — a leak the proxy calls benign but you find ugly. Add its 4-tuple signature here and it counts as a defect.
- `site/leak-force-benign.yaml` — a leak the proxy calls bad but you’ve decided is fine (a legitimate standalone variant). Add its signature here and it stops failing the gate.

A signature is the `[isolated_left, left_chosen, isolated_right, right_chosen]` 4-tuple — copy it straight off the `:: *L a->b | *R c->d` line in the backlog or census. After editing either file, run `uv run python tools/leak_verdict_reconcile.py` to confirm the classifier still reconciles cleanly (it scores the proxy against your historical triage and prints precision/recall).

### Eyeballing leaks

`make check-html-after` regenerates `site/check.html`; open it and scroll to “Auto-generated: isolation leaks”. Each row is tagged `bad` or `benign` and shows the in-context shaping beside the two halves shaped separately. Reach for the `bad` rows first — those are the defects. See [doc/isolation-leaks.md](doc/isolation-leaks.md) for the full workflow.

### Fixing the backlog in bulk (the loop)

Draining a backlog of bad leaks one at a time is the kind of grind meant to be handed to an autonomous loop — but it is _not yet built_, and when it is, it still needs you at the ends: you launch it, and you approve the batch it produces. The brief for that loop (how it diagnoses each dangle, the per-fix verify gate, and the fact that it accumulates fixes and stops for one approval rather than committing on its own) is [doc/definitions/shaping-leak-loop.md](doc/definitions/shaping-leak-loop.md). Until it exists, fixing bad leaks is the same manual loop: pick a backlog entry, apply a subtractive fix, `make test-leaks`, re-bless, repeat.

## What makes a good tester page

A tester page is any side-by-side render harness you generate to eyeball glyph changes and record a verdict — `site/check.html`, a one-off fix gallery, an ad-hoc before/after comparison. A good one removes all ambiguity about _what to look at_ and makes giving a verdict fast enough that you actually do it. The non-negotiables and the niceties, learned from `site/check.html` and the fix-gallery harness:

### Showing the glyphs

- **Put a checkered background behind the rendered glyphs.** Advance width and overhang are invisible against a flat fill, and how long a glyph is — how far it reaches past its own ink — is often exactly what you are checking.
- **Make it unmistakable which two letters are under review.** A test sequence is usually four or five letters, but only one join — two adjacent letters — is the point; the rest is context. Highlight that pair so there is no doubt and mute the surrounding letters. Feedback about the wrong two letters misroutes the fix, so the page must leave zero ambiguity about where to look.
- **Render before and after side by side** by embedding both font builds with `@font-face` (the baseline build lives in `site/before/`; the before/after workflow is the one the auto-generated `site/check.html` documents). The “before” shows the dangle; the “after” shows the fix.

### Recording verdicts fast (the keyboard review loop)

- A **highlighted “current” row** that auto-scrolls to center as you move, so you always know where you are.
- **One-key verdicts that auto-advance**, kept on the home row for one-handed triage — the fix gallery uses `f` = fine/accept, `a` = bad, `x` = complicated (which also jumps you into a note). Tapping a verdict moves to the next row automatically.
- **Up/down navigation on both the arrow keys and letter keys** (`i` / `k`), with Enter inside a note field blurring it and advancing.
- A **per-row note field**, and rows **colored by their verdict** so progress is visible at a glance.
- A **“copy my verdicts” button** that emits _only_ the rows needing attention (a non-default verdict, or a note) as plain text you can paste straight back, with a `<textarea>` fallback for when clipboard access is blocked.

### General

- **Self-contained** — inline all CSS and JS, reference only the font files (relatively), no CDNs — so it works offline and over `make serve`.
- **Don’t hand-edit auto-generated pages.** `site/check.html` is rebuilt wholesale by `tools/build_check_html.py`; put a bespoke harness in its own file, gitignored if it is scratch.

## Understanding

Really, you ought to ask an LLM set to maximum thinking mode to give you the 10¢ tour. Anything written down here would probably be out of date by the time you read it.
