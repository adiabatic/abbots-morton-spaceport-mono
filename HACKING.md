# Abbots Morton Spaceport developer guide

## Making it go

```bash
make all
```

Dependencies are managed with `uv` and defined in `pyproject.toml`.

## Coordinate system

- All coordinates in YAML are in **pixels**
- The build script converts to font units using `pixel_size` from the metadata
- `y_offset` shifts the entire glyph vertically:
  - `0` = bottom of bitmap sits on baseline
  - `-3` = bottom of bitmap is 3 pixels below baseline (for descenders)

## Testing

Open `test/test.html` in a browser to test the font interactively.
