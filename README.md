You can get a copy of the latest .otf and .woff2 files from [the Releases page][r].

## Usage

This font only has Quikscript letters, angled parentheses, and the space character. You’ll want to use it with [Departure Mono][dm], which has all the other characters you’d want.

Also, for pixel-perfect rendering, you’ll want to limit yourself to font sizes that are multiples of 11 **pixels**.

Contrariwise, if you’re aiming for print (in Word or Typst), you don’t need to care about pixel alignment if your target is a 600 DPI laser printer.

### CSS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since Abbots Morton Spaceport doesn’t have a `0` glyph, the [`ch`][ch] CSS unit doesn’t work if Abbots Morton Spaceport is first in the font stack.

[ch]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/length#ch

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Departure Mono';
  src: url(…/fonts/DepartureMono-Regular.woff2) format('woff2');
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Abbots Morton Spaceport Mono';  
  src: url(…/fonts/AbbotsMortonSpaceportMono.woff2) format('woff2');
}

/* or use the significantly structurally different and supported in somewhat older browsers <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/font-feature-settings> */
@font-feature-values 'Abbots Morton Spaceport Mono' {
  @styleset {
    proportional: 1;
  }
}

/* you probably know what selector you want already, but… */
:root {
  font-family: 'Departure Mono', 'Abbots Morton Spaceport Mono', monospace;

  /* <https://caniuse.com/?search=font-smooth> isn’t universally supported yet */
  -webkit-font-smoothing: none;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: unset;
  font-smooth: never;
}
```

### [Typst][tf]

```typst
#set text(
    font: ("Departure Mono", "Abbots Morton Spaceport Mono"),
)
```

[tf]: https://typst.app/docs/reference/text/text/#parameters-font

I’m not sure if the order of these two fonts matters in Typst.

### Microsoft Word

If you want to set a fallback font in Microsoft Word you’ll likely need to do something involved and nerdy, like opening up a saved Theme (it’s a .zip file with XML files in it) and editing its long list of language-dependent fallback fonts. Ask an LLM to help you out here. Also ask it to help you convert sizes in pixels to sizes in points.

Or keep reading…

### Others

You know how people use [Nerd Fonts][] to get their usual fonts with extra glyphs shoved into them? Maybe you could do that kind of thing with this font and Departure Mono.
