"""The section 6.3a explain CLI: replay settlement for a rune sequence and a stylistic-set configuration, printing the full candidate table per position, every elimination attributed to its file and record, and the rank comparison that chose the winner.

Usage: uv run python -m rebuild.pipeline.explain E665:E670:E665 --features ss03

Sequence positions are colon-separated and may be hex codepoints (E665, 0xE665, U+E665) or qs-names (qsMay), mixed freely; `space`, `zwnj`, and `namer-dot` name the boundary tokens. The CLI loads the real rune files through spec_load, falling back to the hand-built fixtures spec with a notice when the loader is unavailable.

The settling is `kernel_exec.settle_sequences`; what this module owns is the report — tokenize, form the ligatures against the crate's guard surface, and dress the traces that come back as the per-position rendering an author reads. `explain_many` takes a whole batch because the review surface explains units by the thousand and the batching is the kernel driver's, not this module's.
