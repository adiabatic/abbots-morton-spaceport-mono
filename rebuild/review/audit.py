"""M1-mode unit assembly for the review surface (rebuild/REVIEW-PLAN.md §1.1, §2.1): load rebuild/out/m1/divergence-audit.tsv and rebuild/m1-divergences.yaml, dedupe the audit rows to (codepoints, baseline, new) units, and order them for triage — ledger class in ledger file order, then lead-family-pair group in code-point order, then codepoints, then the unit's own id (`triage_key`) — with fixed batch slices assigned over that order (`assign_batches`). A unit's id is not assigned here: it is `unit_cache.unit_id_for` over the content key the build stamps once the unit is enriched, so it names what the reviewer judges and nothing about where the unit sits. The name-grain dedupe key can split one visual question into sibling units when a config merely relabels a glyph without moving ink; the build folds those back together with `merge_ink_duplicate_units` before enrichment and batching."""
