The vocabulary check belongs here rather than downstream on the emitted fragment: these rows are the sole source of a unit's `before.seams`, they are read once per config per process, and a table the classifier wrote a compound token into is a bad input rather than a bad fragment. It is also why the table is projected rather than parsed lazily off the raw lines — a check that ran only on the rows the enricher happened to look up would say nothing about the table. No `rowmodel.Row` is built on the way: a line is split once into the five fields `Row.to_tsv` writes and only the three the projection carries are read, so the pen positions — dead on this path by design, see `SubsetRow` — are never parsed at all, and the codepoint key is the field's own text whenever it already has the uppercase four-digit spelling `Row.to_tsv` writes, re-derived through `int` only when it does not. That is where the load's cost is: building a `Row` per line, pens included, would be most of it, and a worker pays the load once per configuration its slice reaches. A table repeats the same few dozen glyph names and the same handful of seam tokens across every row, and nearly every row's cluster starts are the plain run `0, 1, …` and its seams one of a few short tuples, so glyph and seam strings are interned and the cluster and seam tuples memoized on their field's text: a repeat costs a pointer rather than a copy, and a seam field is checked the first time it is seen rather than on every row that repeats it — which still refuses the table at its first bad row, since a field that fails is never memoized. The codepoint key is interned too, through the same `sys.intern` table `audit.load_audit` puts the audit's window strings in, so every configuration's table keys one window on the one string the unit already holds rather than on a copy per table."""

The tuple stands in for the translated geometry this used to build: a shape sits with its leftmost, lowest point at (0, 0) in its own canonical frame, so a placed piece's leftmost point is its absolute x and its translated outline is the canonical value moved by exactly (x - x0, y) — a map the geometry inverts (the leftmost, lowest point gives back the translation, and what remains is the canonical shape the key is derived from), so two pieces compare equal precisely when the translated outlines would, across fonts because both go through one intern. The one shape that map does not invert is one with no point at all, which every translation leaves alone; it is recorded at (0, 0) so its placement is as invisible to the comparison as it was to the translation.
